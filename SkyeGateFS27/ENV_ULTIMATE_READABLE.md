# ENV Ultimate Readable Guide

This is the human-readable companion to [env.ultimate.template](./env.ultimate.template).

Use this file when you want:
- plain-English descriptions of what each env section is for
- official provider signup or console links
- a cleaner onboarding sheet for operators, customers, or teammates

Do **not** paste secrets into this file. Keep actual values in `env.ultimate.template` or in the gate's sovereign vault.

## Canonical Rule

- Canonical machine-oriented env contract: [env.ultimate.template](./env.ultimate.template)
- Human-readable guide: `ENV_ULTIMATE_READABLE.md`
- Admin website env map: generated from `env.ultimate.template` at runtime through `netlify/functions/_lib/repoEnvCatalog.js`
- Build/sync proof: run `npm run build` or `npm run sync:env-website`
- Automatic rebuild: `.github/workflows/skygate-env-website-sync.yml` validates env changes and triggers Netlify when `SKYGATEFS27_NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL` is configured as a GitHub secret

## Core Identity / Auth / Origin

These vars define the parent gate identity, JWT/session signing, encryption, and browser/API origins.

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: admin dashboard login secret
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing base secret
- `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: encryption root for stored secrets
- `KEY_PEPPER`: extra secret for key-hash hardening
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: CORS allowlist
- `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`: public browser origin for redirects and checkout callbacks
- `SKYGATE_ISSUER`: explicit issuer URL if you do not want request-derived issuer logic

## Ownership Matrix

Use this table to decide who should normally own each env group.

| Env group | Typical owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Core identity / auth / origin | Gate-owned | These define the parent authority and should stay under operator control. |
| Database / persistence | Gate-owned | The gate is the parent ledger and should own its main state plane. |
| Runtime control shell | Runtime-shell-only | These wire the SkyeHands runtime control shell, bridge, Theia, and OpenHands lanes into the gate. |
| Shared AI vendors | Gate-owned by default | Best when the gate is providing the house lane, metering usage, and enforcing policy. |
| Customer AI credentials | Customer BYO via sovereign vault | Use when the customer brings their own vendor account but still routes through the gate for approval, tracking, and billing. |
| Vector / RAG vendors | Gate-owned or customer BYO | Depends on whether embeddings/search are house-managed or customer-managed. |
| Push / deploy vendors | Gate-owned for managed delivery | Best when the gate is acting as the parent deploy and source-control authority. |
| QuantumSkyes MCP / AI repo write bridge | Gate-owned runtime bridge | These vars let AI clients authenticate through Skyegate, meter write access, and open PRs through the parent GitHub lane. |
| Billing / commerce | Gate-owned | Parent payment and charging lanes should remain centralized. |
| Communications / mail | Gate-owned or platform-specific | House mail goes in env; customer-owned mail should usually live in the vault. |
| Voice / speech | Gate-owned or customer BYO | Telephony often stays centralized; premium voice vendors may be customer-provided. |
| Cache / infra extras | Gate-owned | Shared infra should be under operator control. |
| Child-platform bridge vars | Runtime-shell-only or platform-specific | These are integration lanes, not customer-owned product creds. |

## Runtime Control Shell

These vars connect the parent gate to the SkyeHands runtime control shell and the modified Theia / OpenHands launch stack.

- `SKYGATEFS27_ORIGIN`
- `SKYGATEFS27_GATE_TOKEN`
- `SKYGATEFS27_GATE_MODEL`
- `SKYGATE_EVENT_MIRROR_SECRET`
- `SKYEQUANTA_*` bridge / runtime vars

## Vendor Ownership Notes

Use this table when deciding whether a vendor should live as a house credential in `env.ultimate.template` or as a customer-provided credential in the sovereign vault.

| Vendor group | Default ownership posture |
|---|---|
| OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Azure OpenAI / xAI / Groq / DeepSeek / Mistral / Together / Perplexity / Fireworks / Cohere / OpenRouter | Gate-owned by default for shared metered lanes; customer BYO supported via sovereign vault |
| Google Cloud / Firebase / Supabase / Neon / Upstash | Gate-owned for parent infrastructure; customer BYO only when isolating a customer’s own stack |
| Pinecone / Qdrant / Weaviate | Gate-owned for house RAG, customer BYO for customer-isolated vector stacks |
| Netlify / GitHub / Cloudflare / Vercel / Railway / Render | Gate-owned when SkyeGate is acting as deploy and push parent |
| QuantumSkyes MCP / AI repo writes | Gate-owned; AI clients authenticate with Skyegate and require `repo.write` for writes |
| Stripe | Gate-owned |
| Twilio / ElevenLabs / AssemblyAI / SMTP / Resend / Postmark / SendGrid / Mailgun | Gate-owned for house comms, customer BYO when they need their own brand/account lane |
| Replicate / Hugging Face / Modal | Gate-owned for managed experiments and house execution, customer BYO for isolated compute spend |

## Billing / Payments

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL`
- `STRIPE_CANCEL_URL`

Use Stripe if the gate should own the payment lane. Customer-owned billing contexts can still be modeled in the sovereign vault, but the parent gate should keep the metering record.

## QuantumSkyes MCP / AI Repo Write Bridge

These vars connect the MCP scaffold to Skyegate and GitHub for live end-to-end AI-assisted repo writes.

- `MCP_API_TOKEN`: local fallback bearer token for non-Skyegate clients
- `MCP_URL`: MCP server URL used by clients and live smoke scripts
- `MCP_DISPATCH_SECRET`: optional shared secret checked by the GitHub Actions `repository_dispatch` workflow
- `SKYE_TOKEN`: Skyegate token used by the example AI client and live smoke proof
- `SKYEGATE_INTROSPECT_URL`: Skyegate endpoint that accepts `{ token }` and returns `{ active: true, sub, roles, aud, ... }`
- `SKYEGATE_AUD`: required audience, usually `mcp`
- `SKYE_BILLING_METER_URL` / `SKYEGATE_BILLING_URL`: optional metering endpoint called before writes
- `SKYE_BILLING_API_KEY`: optional bearer token for the metering endpoint
- `REPO_OWNER` / `REPO_NAME`: GitHub target repository
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: direct GitHub token path
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`: GitHub App installation-token path
- `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL`: defaults to GitHub public API, can point at a compatible mock for proof
- `LIVE_E2E_*`: live proof controls for `npm run smoke:live` in `QuantumSkyes/MCP`

## Communications / Mail

- SMTP is the neutral fallback lane.
- Resend, Postmark, SendGrid, and Mailgun are all modeled as vendor-tracked outbound mail options.

## Voice / Speech

- Twilio is the telephony edge.
- ElevenLabs and AssemblyAI are optional AI voice/speech companions.

## Operational Advice

- Put house credentials in `env.ultimate.template` only when the parent gate should provide and meter them.
- Put customer-owned secrets into the sovereign vault when the customer is bringing their own vendor account.
- Keep provider onboarding, metering, and credential posture visible in the gate dashboards.
