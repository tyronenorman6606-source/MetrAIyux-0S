# SkyeDocxMax

SkyeDocxMax is a standalone, offline-first private document editor and encrypted document vault.

## Runtime Model

SkyeDocxMax is releaseable as a static PWA. The editor, local vault, encrypted `.skye` package handling, export flows, and local cross-app queueing run from this folder without requiring the larger SuperIDEv3 runtime.

Optional Skye ecosystem bridge actions are static-safe:

- If a compatible SuperIDE/Skye backend is available, bridge buttons attempt those API calls.
- If no backend is available, bridge actions write local outbox, bridge, intent, and evidence records into browser storage.
- The release package does not require Netlify Functions or Cloudflare Workers for core document work.

## Supported Formats

Working:

- Encrypted `.skye` export/import
- Direct local `.html` and `.txt` import
- `.txt` export
- HTML ZIP export and re-import
- Browser PDF/print flow

Not currently claimed as complete:

- Microsoft Word/OpenXML `.docx` import/export

The product name contains `Docx` as a brand name. This release is not a verified OpenXML processor until a dedicated `.docx` lane is implemented and smoked.

## Storage

Documents, folders, assets, comments, suggestions, versions, metadata, and local bridge records are stored in browser storage. Users should export backups before clearing browser data.

When the browser exposes the File System Access API in a secure context, open/save flows use the native picker so repeated imports and exports can stay in the same local folder during the active runtime. The app now keeps a session-local runtime log of handle registration, native open, and native save events so the browser smoke can prove the same-folder chain directly. When that API is unavailable, SkyeDocxMax falls back to standard browser upload/download behavior.

## Encryption

Encrypted `.skye` packages use the bundled runtime at `_shared/skye/skyeSecure.js`. Recovery/failsafe kit generation is supported for encrypted exports.

## PWA

The PWA uses:

- `manifest.webmanifest`
- `manifest.json` for compatibility with static hosts that probe this filename
- `service-worker.js`
- `offline.html`

Both manifests are intentionally retained and must stay equivalent.

## Browser Smoke

From the SkyeHands root, start a local static server for this folder:

```bash
cd /home/lordkaixu/ALPHA-13/s332-/SkyeHands-main/AbovetheSkye-Platforms/SkyeDocxMax
python3 -m http.server <local-dev-port>
```

Run the full smoke:

```bash
cd /home/lordkaixu/ALPHA-13/s332-/SkyeHands-main/AbovetheSkye-Platforms/SkyeDocxMax
node smoke/smoke-proof-contract.mjs
SKYEDOCXMAX_SMOKE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<local-dev-port>/index.html node smoke/smoke-standalone.mjs
SKYEDOCXMAX_SMOKE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<local-dev-port>/index.html node smoke-full-standalone.mjs
```

## Honest Runtime Boundaries

This folder proves the local PWA editor, encrypted `.skye` handling, local `.html`/`.txt` import, browser-local vault state, same-folder file-picker save/open behavior where supported, runtime handle/event evidence for that same-folder chain, and local bridge fallback behavior. It does not by itself prove Microsoft Word/OpenXML `.docx` import/export, deployed backend bridge services, or multi-user hosted collaboration.

## Release Files

- `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` lists release files.
- `SkyeDocxMax_SMOKE_RESULTS.json` records the latest full browser smoke result.
- `SkyeDocxMax_RELEASE_READY_v1.zip` is the clean static release package.
