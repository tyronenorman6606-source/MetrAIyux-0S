# Kaixu Multimodal Gateway Hardened Patch — Build Directive

## Identity

This ZIP is **not** a frontend app, a launcher, or a sales site.

It is a **Cloudflare Worker gateway patch pack** intended to harden an existing Kaixu gate into a **lane-aware multimodal sovereign gateway**.

The pack adds or expands these responsibilities:

- public Kaixu API lanes for chat, stream, images, videos, speech, transcriptions, realtime, usage, and jobs
- app-token auth and admin-token auth
- D1-backed wallet, pricing, routing, trace, and job persistence
- OpenAI lane adapters split by task instead of one fake universal handler
- provider abstraction for OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic
- normalized public-safe responses that hide upstream vendor/model truth from non-admin callers

In plain English: this is a **backend gate brain patch**.

---

## What gate/auth model it is using

### App auth

This pack uses its **own app-token gate**.

Primary file:
- `src/auth/verifyAppToken.ts`

Behavior:
- expects `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- SHA-256 hashes the presented token
- looks up the hash in `app_tokens`
- loads app/org/wallet/allowed-alias context from D1

So this is **not** Netlify Identity and **not** browser-only fake auth.

### Admin auth

This pack uses its **own admin bearer token gate**.

Primary file:
- `src/auth/verifyAdminToken.ts`

Behavior:
- expects `Authorization: Bearer <KAIXU_ADMIN_TOKEN>`
- compares directly to `KAIXU_ADMIN_TOKEN` or `ADMIN_MASTER_TOKEN`

---

## Is the gate self-contained?

## Short verdict

**Yes as source code. No as live infrastructure.**

### Self-contained in the ZIP as code

Included here:
- Cloudflare Worker entrypoint: `src/index.ts`
- request router: `src/router.ts`
- auth logic: `src/auth/*`
- provider logic: `src/providers/*`
- adapters: `src/adapters/*`
- routing logic: `src/routing/*`
- ledger logic: `src/ledger/*`
- D1 schema + migrations + seed: `src/db/*`
- deployment config: `wrangler.jsonc`
- environment guidance: `docs/env-example.md`

### Not self-running by itself

Still required outside the ZIP:
- deployed Cloudflare Worker
- bound D1 database
- worker secrets such as:
  - `KAIXU_ADMIN_TOKEN`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or lane-specific keys
  - optional provider/model overrides
- D1 migration execution / seed execution

So the code is here, but the living dragon still needs its cave, keys, and food.

## What is already solid

### 1. Real gateway structure

This is a real Worker-first gateway layout, not a browser toy.

### 2. Auth is server-side and database-backed for apps

`verifyAppToken.ts` is doing a real token-hash lookup against D1.

### 3. The pack is lane-aware

The code stops pretending one endpoint can do text, images, audio, video, and realtime the same way.

### 4. Public/admin separation exists

The docs and handlers are designed so public callers see Kaixu-safe envelopes while admin routes can inspect upstream truth.

### 5. Wallet / trace / jobs model is here

This is important because it turns the gate into a metered control plane instead of a dumb API proxy.

---

## What is unfinished or mismatched

### 1. Route files are mounted in the router

Current router file:
- `src/router.ts`

Currently wired public routes:
- `/v1/health`
- `/v1/models`
- `/v1/chat`
- `/v1/stream`
- `/v1/images`
- `/v1/videos`
- `/v1/audio/speech`
- `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- `/v1/realtime/session`
- `/v1/usage`
- `/v1/embeddings`
- `/v1/wallet`
- `/v1/wallet/balance`
- `/v1/jobs/:job_id`

Currently wired admin routes:
- `/admin/traces/:trace_id`
- `/admin/jobs/:job_id`
- `/admin/upstream/:trace_id`
- `/admin/retry/:job_id`
- `/admin/cancel/:job_id`
- `/admin/providers`
- `/admin/aliases`
- `/admin/routing`
- `/admin/wallets`

The previously extra route files are now exposed by the active router.

### 2. Embeddings exists in types, route code, and the live router

Signals:
- `KaixuEngineAlias` includes `kaixu/embed`
- `SkyEmbeddingsRequest` exists in `src/types.ts`
- `handleEmbeddings` exists in `src/routes/embeddings.ts`
- router exposes a `/v1/embeddings` endpoint

So embeddings is part of the active public contract.

### 3. Documentation and live route exposure are aligned for the added lanes

`docs/api-contract.md` focuses on the currently wired public contract.

The router now exposes the additional route files that this directive previously called out.

### 4. The package name and naming are misaligned with purpose

Current package/worker naming:
- package name: `kaixu-super-gate`
- Wrangler name: `kaixu-super-gate`
- root folder: `sky-currency-additive-pack`

This repo is doing more than currency. The folder name undersells and confuses the actual system role.

### 5. Multi-provider posture is structurally present but likely OpenAI-first in reality

Provider support exists for:
- OpenAI
- Gemini
- Anthropic

But the env model and adapter depth are clearly strongest on the OpenAI lane split. Treat Gemini and Anthropic as secondary until proven with acceptance tests.

---

## Build classification

This asset should be treated as:

**Kaixu Sovereign Multimodal Gateway Patch / Worker Brain Additive Pack**

Not as:
- a frontend app
- a complete admin UI
- a customer portal
- a self-booting full product by itself

---

## Immediate patch goals

If you are adjusting this in your codebase, do these first.

### Goal 1: Decide the public contract

Choose one of these paths:

Path B is now applied: the extra lane routes are wired and the contract/docs should stay matched to `src/router.ts`.

### Goal 2: Normalize naming

Rename the root package/folder so it reflects gateway reality, not only currency.

Suggested direction:
- `kaixu-super-gate/`
- or `kaixu-multimodal-gateway/`

### Goal 3: Align docs, router, and acceptance checklist

The router and docs now expose the same route surface for these lanes.



---

## Recommended router patch plan

The active router imports the added route files in `src/router.ts`.

Suggested additions:

```ts
import { handleEmbeddings } from './routes/embeddings'
import { handleWalletBalance } from './routes/wallet-balance'
import { handleAdminProviders } from './routes/admin-providers'
import { handleAdminAliases } from './routes/admin-aliases'
import { handleAdminRouting } from './routes/admin-routing'
import { handleAdminWallets } from './routes/admin-wallets'
```

Suggested public route additions:

```ts
if (path === '/v1/embeddings' && method === 'POST') return await handleEmbeddings(request, env)
if (path === '/v1/wallet' && method === 'GET') return await handleWalletBalance(request, env)
```

Suggested admin route additions:

```ts
if (path === '/admin/providers' && method === 'GET') return await handleAdminProviders(request, env)
if (path === '/admin/aliases' && method === 'GET') return await handleAdminAliases(request, env)
if (path === '/admin/routing' && method === 'GET') return await handleAdminRouting(request, env)
if (path === '/admin/wallets' && method === 'POST') return await handleAdminWallets(request, env)
```

Use the actual handler names from each file if they differ. Verify before paste.

## Patch order

### Phase 1 — Make the current pack truthful

1. Verify `src/router.ts` against all files in `src/routes/`
2. Decide which extra routes are real release routes vs dormant stubs
3. Update `docs/api-contract.md`
4. Update `docs/acceptance-checklist.md`

### Phase 2 — Make deployments predictable

1. confirm `wrangler.jsonc` D1 binding
2. set all required secrets
3. run migrations in order:
   - `0001_init.sql`
   - `0002_multimodal_hardening.sql`
4. seed baseline provider / alias / pricing data if needed

### Phase 3 — Make the gate coherent

1. normalize package/folder naming
2. normalize branding vars:
   - `KAIXU_PUBLIC_BRAND`
   - `KAIXU_GATE_NAME`
3. ensure every frontend app calls Kaixu routes only
4. remove any direct vendor calls from app surfaces

### Phase 4 — Prove it actually lives

Run acceptance tests for:
- health
- models
- chat
- stream
- images
- videos create + poll
- speech
- transcription
- realtime session
- usage
- jobs poll
- admin trace inspection
- admin job inspection
- admin retry/cancel
- embeddings if you expose it
- wallet route if you expose it

## Truthful final verdict

### What this is

A **Kaixu multimodal sovereign gateway backend patch pack** for Cloudflare Workers + D1.

### What auth/gate it uses

- **App callers:** Bearer app token checked against hashed `app_tokens` in D1
- **Admin callers:** Bearer admin token checked against `KAIXU_ADMIN_TOKEN`

### Is the gate self-contained?

- **As source code:** yes, mostly
- **As live deployed infrastructure:** no, it still needs Worker deployment, D1 binding, secrets, migrations, and seed data

### Main weakness right now

The pack contains more functionality than the active router exposes. In other words, the beast has extra limbs folded behind its back.

### Main action

Normalize the contract, wire the missing routes you actually want live, and deploy it as the real Kaixu multimodal gate instead of letting it live as a half-awake patch goblin.
