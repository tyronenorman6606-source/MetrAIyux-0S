# SkyeGateFS27 CitadelDB

`SkyeGateFS27` is the CitadelDB-branded deployment lane for the existing SkyeGateFS27 auth and gateway system.

The bridge keeps the FS27 routes and database contract stable so existing deployments and keys remain compatible while CitadelDB can use the gate for operator auth, platform event mirroring, and deployment tracking.

See `SKYGATEFS27_CITADELDB_BRIDGE.md` for the exact CitadelDB bridge contract.

# SkyeGateFS27 Base

`SkyeGateFS27` is the explicit sovereign auth and gateway project for the SkyeHands ecosystem.

It is derived from `kAIxUGateway13`, but it is not meant to stay conceptually buried inside that ancestor. This folder is the clear upgrade target: the place where the combined auth, OAuth/OIDC, JWKS, session, app-client, policy, key, billing, and gateway authority now lives.

`kAIxUGateway13` should be treated as the operational ancestor and compatibility base. `SkyeGateFS27` is the named end-state.

Current truth docs:
- `docs/SKYGATEFS27_STATUS_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/SKYGATEFS27_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/SKYGATEFS27_LIVE_VAR_BLOCKERS.md`
- `docs/SKYGATEFS27_OWNERSHIP_BOUNDARY.md`

This build keeps ops tiny (Netlify DB + Netlify Functions) while adding the missing real-world controls: **universal caps**, **device seats**, **allowlists**, **exports**, **invoice snapshots**, and **Stripe top-ups**.

## What’s in
1) **Gateway**: multi-provider proxy with **SSE streaming** + non-streaming JSON
2) **Auth**: customers + sub-keys (many keys per customer)
   - plus central `SkyeGateFS27` identity, session, OAuth/OIDC, JWKS, and app-client authority
3) **Universal caps**: 
   - customer monthly cap
   - key override cap
   - optional “top-up” extra cap per month
4) **Rate limiting**:
   - Netlify DB counters (default)
   - **Upstash sliding-window limiter** (optional, recommended)
5) **Devices / Seats**:
   - optional `x-kaixu-install-id` binding
   - key-level max seats (override) and customer-level max seats (default)
   - revoke/unrevoke devices
6) **Allowlists**:
   - provider allowlist (customer or key override)
   - model allowlist (customer or key override)
7) **Usage metering + logs** (Netlify DB)
8) **Exports** (CSV): events, monthly summary, invoice export
9) **Invoice snapshots**: compute + store per month (admin) and view (user)
10) **Stripe top-ups** (optional): Checkout + webhook credits `extra_cents`
11) **Dashboards**:
   - Admin console (`/index.html`)
   - User console (`/dashboard.html`)
12) **Repo-wide env contract**:
   - canonical deployment + integration sheet (`/env.ultimate.template`)

## Netlify DB native ✅
- Uses Netlify DB (Neon Postgres) via `@netlify/neon`.
- No `DATABASE_URL` needed; Netlify injects `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` when DB is attached.

## Pricing (P0 / production blocker)
Billing + caps depend on `pricing/pricing.json`.

This build ships with pricing entries for internal gateway lanes.

All rates are **provider list price + 31%** (your markup).

Important behavior:
- If a request uses a (provider, model) pair **not present** in `pricing.json`, the gateway returns **409 UNPRICED_MODEL** (no “$0” bypass).
- Make sure your customer/key model allowlists only include models that exist in `pricing.json`.

## KaixuPush enterprise boundary (Netlify tokens)
By default, KaixuPush can use a single site-wide `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`. That’s convenient, but not multi-tenant safe.

This build supports **per-customer Netlify tokens**, stored encrypted in Netlify DB:

- Set/clear from Admin UI (Customers tab), or call:
  - `POST /.netlify/functions/admin-netlify-token` with `{ customer_id, token }`
  - `DELETE /.netlify/functions/admin-netlify-token` with `{ customer_id }`

KaixuPush will:
1) Use the customer’s encrypted token if present.
2) Otherwise fall back to `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` (back-compat).


## Deploy checklist
### 0) Choose your deploy path (important)
This project includes **Netlify Functions with NPM dependencies** (Neon DB, Blobs, optional Stripe/Upstash). That means the Functions must be **bundled** as part of deployment.

Supported paths:

**Recommended (production): Git-connected deploy**
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo and connect it to Netlify.
- Netlify will run the build/bundle step for Functions during deploy.

**Manual (no Git): Netlify CLI deploy**
- Run the included script:
  - macOS/Linux: `bash scripts/deploy.sh`
  - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\deploy.ps1`
- The script runs:
  - `npm install`
  - `npx netlify functions:build`
  - `npx netlify deploy --prod`

**Drag/drop (Netlify Drop): static-only unless you prebundle Functions**
- Drag/drop deployments do not run a dependency install or Functions build step.
- You can still drop this site, but **only the static dashboards will work** unless you prebundle the Functions artifacts.

Why: Netlify’s manual deploy workflow does not automatically install dependencies and bundle Functions unless you deploy via Git or the Netlify CLI (or you ship prebuilt Function bundles).

References:
- https://docs.netlify.com/deploy/create-deploys/ (manual deploys don’t run a build command)
- https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/deploy/ (deploying Functions via Git/CLI)



### A) Add Netlify DB (Neon)
- Netlify UI: **Extensions → Neon database → Install → Add database**

### B) Database schema (auto-provisioned)
You **do not** need to run any manual SQL to get started.

On first real request, `netlify/functions/_lib/db.js` automatically creates/patches the required tables & columns (customers, keys, usage, invoices, devices, push tables, monitor tables, async jobs, etc.).

- The `/sql` folder is kept as **reference / legacy migration notes** only.
- In a later “ops-hardened” deployment, you can move schema management to explicit migrations and disable request-path DDL, for strict ops discipline, but this repo currently prioritizes rapid setup over cold-start optimization.

### C) Netlify env vars
Required:
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Optional hardening:
- `DISABLE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HEADER=true` to disable legacy `x-admin-password` header auth and require admin JWTs only.
- `AUTH_EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL` to deliver verification/reset/provisioning mail through your provider, or `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM` for direct Resend delivery
- `SKYGATE_ISSUER` to pin issuer metadata instead of deriving it from request host

Providers (set internal lane credentials server-side as needed):
- internal provider credentials (optional, gateway-managed)

CORS:
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` = comma-separated list (e.g. https://yourapp.com,https://admin.yourapp.com)
- **Production:** you MUST set this explicitly.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*` enables allow-all (dev only).
- If `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unset/blank and a browser `Origin` header is present, the gateway does **not** grant CORS (strict-by-default).

Rate limits:
- `DEFAULT_RPM_LIMIT` (example: 120)

Optional (stronger RPM limiting with Upstash):
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

Optional (Stripe top-ups):
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `STRIPE_CURRENCY` (default `usd`)
- `STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL` and `STRIPE_CANCEL_URL` (or set `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN`)
- `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` (e.g. https://your-site.netlify.app)

- `/.netlify/functions/user-topup-checkout`

## Local dev
1) Install deps: `npm i`
2) Start: `netlify dev`

Useful local verification:
- `npm run validate:env` validates `env.ultimate.template` against the repo env catalog
- `npm run audit:consumers` scans major consumer surfaces for gate-adoption signals
- `node ./scripts/e2e-local.mjs` remains available for local end-to-end flows when your local gate stack is running

Netlify DB requires Node 20.12.2+. This repo includes `.node-version` and sets Node in `netlify.toml`.

## kAIxu canon enforcement (server-side)

This build **forces** the kAIxu origin + governance canon on every request.
- The gateway prepends a **system** instruction block (the “kAIxu CANON”) to every request **before** calling any provider.
- Any client-provided system/developer prompts are kept, but appended *after* the canon (so they cannot erase it).
- Health endpoint exposes a hash so you can verify what is enforced.

Check: `/.netlify/functions/health` → `build.kaixu_system_hash`
Build: `deploy-kaixuCanon-20260221102017`


## Async Jobs (Background + Polling) — for long DEV outputs

Netlify serverless streaming can still hit timeouts when "time to first token" is slow or responses are huge.  
This repo now supports **Background Job + Polling** (15-minute worker limit on Netlify Background Functions).

### 1) Submit a job
`POST /.netlify/functions/gateway-job-submit`

Headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer <virtual_key>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

Body (same as gateway-chat):
```json
{
  "provider": "kaixu",
  "model": "kaixu-chat",
  "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Write a long response..."}],
  "max_tokens": 8192,
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

Response (202):
- `job_id`
- `status_url`
- `result_url`

### 2) Poll status
`GET status_url`  
Optional: `&kick=1` will re-trigger the worker if the job is still queued/running.

### 3) Fetch final result
`GET result_url`  
- returns 200 when complete
- returns 202 if still running
- returns 500 if failed

### Security note (recommended)
Set `JOB_WORKER_SECRET` in Netlify env vars. The enqueue function will pass it to the background worker using `x-kaixu-job-secret`.

## Gateway Base Switch (no rebuild)

The Admin + User dashboards now include a **Gateway Base** switch (top right). This lets you point the UI at:

- the **Netlify-hosted gateway** (default)
- your **Dedicated gateway (VPS / Docker / container)**

How it works:
- If **Gateway Base** is blank, the dashboard calls the **same site** you loaded the page from.
- If you set it to a full URL like `https://gateway.yourdomain.com`, all API calls are sent to:
  `https://gateway.yourdomain.com/.netlify/functions/...`

Where it’s stored:
- Browser localStorage key: `KAIXU_API_BASE`
- Per device / per browser profile.

Quick use:
1) Open **Admin** (`/index.html`) or **User Dashboard** (`/dashboard.html`)
2) Click **Gateway Base**
3) Paste your dedicated base (example: `https://gateway.yourdomain.com`)
4) Click **Save**
5) Use “Open Health for this base” to verify you’re hitting the right gateway.

Tip:
- If you run the dedicated gateway on plain HTTP for local testing, that works too.


## Monitor (Admin)

The Admin panel now includes a **Monitor** tab that acts like a live event listener for gateway problems.

What it captures:
- Returned HTTP errors (4xx/5xx) from any function
- Thrown errors (uncaught exceptions) with stack traces
- Upstream/provider failures with upstream status + truncated provider body
- Slow responses (>= 15s)

How you debug fast:
1) Every gateway response includes the header `x-kaixu-request-id`.
2) In Admin → Monitor, paste that value into **Search request_id** and hit Search.
3) Click the event row to open the full JSON payload (copy button included).

Strongly recommended (for your apps):
- Send `x-kaixu-app: <app-name>` and `x-kaixu-build: <build-id>` on every request to the gateway.
- Optionally send `x-kaixu-request-id: <uuid>` if your client already generates trace IDs.

Monitor endpoints:
- `GET /.netlify/functions/admin-monitor-events` (polling)
- `GET /.netlify/functions/admin-monitor-stream` (live SSE over fetch)
- `POST /.netlify/functions/admin-monitor-prune` (delete old logs)



## AUTO MODE client pattern (SSE vs Job+Polling)

For IDE-style apps where **sometimes** responses are small (streaming works great) and sometimes they’re huge (serverless streaming can time out), use the built-in client helper:

- File: `assets/kaixu-client.js`
- Global: `window.KaixuClient`

### Quick usage (browser)

1) Load the helper in your app:

```html
<script src="https://YOUR-GATEWAY-SITE.netlify.app/assets/kaixu-client.js"></script>
```

2) Call `KaixuClient.autoChat(...)`:

```js
await KaixuClient.autoChat({
  apiBase: "https://gateway.yourdomain.com", // optional; omit to use same-origin / KAIXU_API_BASE
  apiKey: "<YOUR_KEY>",
  payload: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    messages: [{ role:"user", content:"Generate a large multi-file code output..." }],
    max_tokens: 3000
  },
  expectLargeOutput: true,         // optional hint (DEV mode)
  onMeta:  (m)=>console.log(m),    // stream meta OR job submit info
  onDelta: (t)=>appendToUI(t),     // only in stream mode
  onStatus:(s)=>console.log(s),    // only in job mode (poll status)
  onDone:  (d)=>console.log(d)     // stream done OR job result
});
```

AUTO MODE behavior:
- If the request looks “big” (high `max_tokens`, large message size, or `expectLargeOutput: true`), it uses **Background Job + Polling**.
- Otherwise it tries **SSE streaming** first.
- If SSE fails (or no first token arrives fast enough), it **falls back** to Job+Polling automatically.

See `examples/auto-client.js` for a working pattern.

## Client Error Reporter (front-end errors → Admin Monitor)

Endpoint:
- `POST /.netlify/functions/client-error-report`

Headers (recommended):
- `x-kaixu-app: SkyIDE`
- `x-kaixu-build: skyide-2026.02.21`
- Optional security:
  - If you set `CLIENT_ERROR_TOKEN` in env, the client must send `x-kaixu-error-token: <same value>`

Body (minimal):
```json
{
  "client": { "url": "https://app...", "route": "/editor", "feature_flags": { "dev": true } },
  "error": { "name": "TypeError", "message": "x is undefined", "stack": "..." },
  "context": { "anything": "useful" }
}
```

Browser helper:
- `KaixuClient.reportClientError(...)`
- `KaixuClient.installGlobalErrorHooks(...)` (captures `window.onerror` + `unhandledrejection`)

See `examples/client-error-reporter.js`.

### Viewing these in Admin → Monitor
Client errors appear as:
- `kind = client_error`
Use the Monitor filters (Level/Kind/App/Function/Request ID) to isolate the exact failing app and paste the full JSON into your IDE for repairs.


## GitHub Push Gateway (optional add-on)

This build can also act as a **GitHub push gateway**: upload a ZIP (chunked), then the gateway commits the extracted files to a GitHub repo/branch using the GitHub REST Git database APIs (blobs → tree → commit → ref update).

### Configure GitHub access

Option A (recommended): GitHub OAuth App (web flow)
- Set env vars:
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
  - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
  - GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL (must match your OAuth app callback URL)
- Connect:
  - POST /.netlify/functions/github-oauth-start (Bearer Kaixu Key with admin role)
  - Open `authorize_url` in browser, approve
  - Callback stores the token encrypted per-customer

Option B: Fine-grained PAT / classic PAT
- Store per-customer via admin endpoint:
  - POST /.netlify/functions/admin-github-token

Token permissions needed:
- Fine-grained: Repository Contents = write (and Workflows = write if touching .github/workflows)
- Classic: repo scope (and workflow scope if touching workflows)

### GitHub Push (ZIP → commit)

1) Init a job
- POST /.netlify/functions/gh-push-init
  - body: { owner, repo, branch, message }

2) Upload ZIP chunks
- PUT /.netlify/functions/gh-push-upload-chunk?jobId=...&part=0&parts=N  (binary body)
- repeat for part 1..N-1

3) Complete (queue background commit)
- POST /.netlify/functions/gh-push-upload-complete
  - body: { jobId }

4) Poll status
- GET /.netlify/functions/gh-push-status?jobId=...

Background worker requires JOB_WORKER_SECRET (set in env vars).

### Useful endpoints
- GET /.netlify/functions/github-whoami
- GET /.netlify/functions/github-repos
- POST /.netlify/functions/github-create-repo


## V6 Notes
- GitHub Push now uses a dedicated Netlify Blobs store: `kaixu_github_push_chunks`.
- Added scheduled cleanup: `gh-chunk-cleanup` (@daily).
- Admin UI includes a GitHub Push tab for token status, repo list, and job list.

## Kaixu Voice Engine (Inbound AI Phone Assistant)

This build adds a **Twilio-compatible inbound call assistant** that runs inside the gateway as Netlify Functions.
It uses a cheap + reliable **TwiML Gather Speech loop** (speech → text → LLM → speech) and is designed to evolve into
realtime streaming later without changing your customer-facing API.

### What you get

- Public webhooks (Twilio → Kaixu):
  - `/.netlify/functions/voice-twilio-inbound` (A Call Comes In)
  - `/.netlify/functions/voice-twilio-turn` (conversation loop)
  - `/.netlify/functions/voice-twilio-status` (status callback; closes calls + rollups)
- Admin provisioning:
  - `/.netlify/functions/admin-voice-numbers` (CRUD voice numbers + playbooks)
  - `/.netlify/functions/admin-voice-usage` (monthly rollups)
- Customer visibility (via their normal gateway virtual keys):
  - `/.netlify/functions/user-voice-summary`
  - `/.netlify/functions/user-voice-calls`

### Database tables added

- `voice_numbers` (maps a phone number to a customer + playbook)
- `voice_calls` (per-call audit + costs)
- `voice_call_messages` (turn-by-turn transcript)
- `voice_usage_monthly` (minutes + estimated cost + billed cost w/ markup)

### Twilio setup (minimal)

1) Buy/attach a phone number in Twilio.
2) In Twilio number settings:
   - Voice → **A CALL COMES IN** → Webhook:
     - `https://YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE/.netlify/functions/voice-twilio-inbound`
   - Status Callback URL (recommended):
     - `https://YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE/.netlify/functions/voice-twilio-status`
     - Status events: initiated, ringing, answered, completed
3) In Netlify env vars, set:
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (required for signature validation)
   - Optional: `VOICE_FALLBACK_TRANSFER_NUMBER`

### Provision a customer number (Admin)

Call `admin-voice-numbers` (admin-auth required via `x-admin-password`) to create a mapping:

POST `/.netlify/functions/admin-voice-numbers`

```json
{
  "customer_id": 123,
  "phone_number": "+14805551234",
  "provider": "twilio",
  "default_llm_provider": "openai",
  "default_llm_model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "timezone": "America/Phoenix",
  "playbook": {
    "greeting": "Skyes Over London. How can I help you today?",
    "system_prompt": "You are a SOLEnterprises business assistant. Keep responses concise. Ask one question at a time.",
    "transfer_number": "+14804695416"
  }
}
```

### How billing is calculated

On terminal call status, the gateway:
- Computes minutes = `ceil(duration_seconds / 60)`
- Calculates estimated upstream cost using env defaults:
  - `VOICE_AI_RELAY_USD_PER_MIN` + `VOICE_TELEPHONY_USD_PER_MIN` + `VOICE_RECORDING_USD_PER_MIN`
- Applies markup (`VOICE_MARKUP_PCT`, default 31%)
- Stores per-call costs and monthly rollups in `voice_usage_monthly`

This is designed to match your “gateway pays upstream, customers pay you” model.

### Upgrade path (next)

- Replace Gather-loop with Twilio ConversationRelay or SIP audio streaming
- Add outbound campaigns + scheduled followups
- Add live monitoring via WebSocket (active calls, interruption stats, sentiment)
- Add per-tenant policies (DLP/redaction, restricted actions, approvals)
